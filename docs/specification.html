		<h1>Specification</h1>
		<p>I am torn between making a mobile app or a website.  It seems to me that it would be better as a mobile app (authentication and integration with the camera of a smartphone for photoing receipts seems convienient, and we need the appication to be easy to use).</p>
		<p>In the interest of expediency the first draft will be a website even though it really ought to be a mobile app.</p>
		<p>User stories</p>
		<ol>
			<li>As a staff member I am able to log in securely using my credentials.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, once I log in I am prompted the select the location of my shift.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, once my location has been determined, I see a summary of the list of room numbers and the available funds of the account of each room.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, I can click on a room number and see a summary of the activity of the account, including cash issued, time and date and by which staff member, cash recieved time and date and by which staff member.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, I have the option to issue cash to room numbers that have available funds.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, I do not have the option of issuing cash to room numbers that either do not have funds, or have unaccounted cash already issued.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, I have the option of accounting for outstanding cash issued to any room number.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, when I account for cash issued to room numbers, I am required to upload a photo of a receipt, and write an amount for which the account should be debited.  Alternatively, I must record that no receipt was provided.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, when accounting for cash issued I should be able to write a note, readable by other staff members, when accounting for cash.</li>
			<li>As a staff member, I should be able to request an audit of a location.  This audit should detail every transaction by every room number, including photos uploaded of the reciepts and the who issued the cash and who accounted for any change returned.</li>
