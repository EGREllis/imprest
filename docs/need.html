		<title>Need for Imprest</title>

		<h1>Need</h1>
		<p>I spent time in an NHS rehabilitation unit.  The patients rehabilitation units are allocated a small budget to by food and drinks.  This budget is called Imprest.</p>
		<p>During my stay I noticed that the process for administering this budget is manual, labour intensive and error prone.</p>
		<p>This application is intended to assist rehabilitation staff administering these Imprest budgets.</p>
		<h2>What processes surround the Imprest?</h2>
		<p>The Imprest can be accessed either in advance or as a refund.</p>
		<p>If the Imprest is accessed in advance, the patient requests an amount of money from the staff member.  The staff member makes an effort to check the Imprest balance for that patient.  If the amount requested is available and sufficient change is available, the staff member fetches the money from a supply and checks the money out against the patients account.  Sometimes there was insufficient change and the staff would present more cash than requested, recording that they had given this to the patient.  The patient then goes off and spends the money, hopefully on eligible food and drink.  The patient returns with a receipt and possibly some change.  The patient presents the change to a staff member (possibly not the same staff member).  The staff member compares the change given with the receipt and the amount issued to check that they tally.  If they tally the staff member keeps the reciept and the change, books the change back into the money store and the transaction is complete.</p>
		<p>If the Imprest is accessed as a refund the process is simpler.  The patient is allowed out to spend their own money.  The patient returns with a receipt.  The staff member checks that the reciept has valid items on it (some items may be prohibited).  Assuming everything is in order, the staff member checks out the amount of money shown on the receipt from the money store and retains the reciept.</p>
		<p>I suspect that patients that have been found to be unreliable are only allowed to access the Imprest as a refund, but I don't know for a fact as it was never an issue.</p>
		<h2>What can go wrong</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>1) The staff member might be too busy or tired to check the balance (which is stored as a list of expenditure).</li>
			<li>2) The tally can be inaccurate (It may be that no-one has updated the tally since the shift changed, there was a separate record for checking in money that was more reliably completed).</li>
			<li>3) The patient can return without a receipt.  It is left up to the staff discretion as to how to treat this.</li>
			<li>4) There may be insufficient change available in the money store, leading the the patient possibly being in possession of more money than they requested until they return with the change.</li>
			<li>5) The patient may purchase prohibited items, or simply not spend the money on food and drink</li>
			<li>6) The summary tally or the list of receipts may not tally with the amount of money in the money store - this leads to staff performing a reconciliation of all reciepts spent and amounts issued in the last week.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Item (6) in particular can be a big deal.  At the rehabilitation centre I was at there was capacity for approximately 10-14 patients.  Each patient could request money, possibly more than once per day and staff could make mistakes checking in the money.  Some poor soul had to manually process the books, recipts, transaction records until the discrepancies had been found/accounted for.  The staff hated this job, which meant they put it off where they could, increaseing the work load for the poor soul that drew the short straw.</p>
		<p>I believe the books were tallied each week and reported back to the main office to ensure that the staff were also not helping themselves to the money store, not that they would do that.</p>
		<h2>What could be improved</h2>
		<p>Making an electronic copy of the budgeting process could make the process less of a pain for the people that need to use it and increase transparency for everyone.<p>
		<p>Specifically, the patients and the staff alike could tell at a glance what balance is available for each patient and how much money ought to be in the store.<p>
		<p>The system would need to keep track of every detail in order to function correctly.<p>
		<p>For example, it would need to track the amount of money issued to a patient in the event there was insufficient change and the patient was presented with more money than requested.</p>
		<p>It would also need to keep track of the money issued in case there was a shift change between the time the money was issued and the time the patient returned.<p>
		<p>It also ought to be possible for the patients to check their own balances before making requests to staff.</p>
		<p>It ought to keep a record of the reciepts in the event that the books need to be tallied manually.</p>
		<p>Patients ought to be able to check their own balance, but not the balance of other patients.</p>
		<p>If possible patients names ought not to be recorded as I am sure there are privacy/data protection concerns.</p>
